If a website only works while downloaded locally, you'll need to download it from the WayBack Machine to view it.<br>
<br>
To download a website manually, follow these instructions:<br>
1 - Click the "MD5 Checksums" button on the page for an archived website you wish to view.<br>
2 - Go to each URL in this list, adding web.archive.org/web/0id_/ at the beginning of each URL (if the link is dead, try web.archive.org/web/*/ to see archives from other points in time).<br>
3 - Save each URL in the same file structure.<br>
<br>
Example:<br>
<br>
The list of MD5 Checksums shows "7169936270B03B661027356F0D2F94BD *professorlayton.nintendo.com\unwoundfuture\_ui\img\flash\demos\hat.jpg",
so you go to web.archive.org/web/0id_/professorlayton.nintendo.com/unwoundfuture/_ui/img/flash/demos/hat.jpg.<br>
<br>
You create a folder named unwoundfuture, and save the file in unwoundfuture\_ui\img\flash\demos with the same name.<br>
<br>
You should now have unwoundfuture\_ui\img\flash\demos\hat.jpg.<br>
<br>
Once you do this with every URL, the website should work offline.<br>
