Hello!
<br><br>
I decided to create a simple website listing everything I've
archived. Since most of the stuff I archive
are flash sites which work on the Wii, I thought I'd use the old
concept I made for the Open Shop Channel for the layout.
<br><br>
Everything listed here is saved on the Internet Archive, being either
websites and online games saved to the WayBack Machine or shareware
saved to the Internet Archive's shareware library.
<br><br>
I mainly list stuff I've archived myself and are new to the Internet
Archive or were missing assets (mainly flash content), but you can also find
flash content archived by others  which are compatible with the Wii by going to "Search" then "Archived by Others".
<br><br>
I will try my best to provide updates on the front page about
new additions.
