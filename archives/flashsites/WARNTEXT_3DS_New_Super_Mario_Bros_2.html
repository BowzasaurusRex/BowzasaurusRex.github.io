This archive of New Super Mario Bros. 2's flash site has the following issues:<br>
<br>
- There are issues with Javascript on the DLC page<br>
- The WayBack Machine seems to not load the website properly, I'm pretty sure it worked previously. All of the URLs listed in the MD5 Checksums section should be saved.<br>
(Loads "https://common/css" instead of "https://www.nintendo.co.jp/common/css" for example.)
