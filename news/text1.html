Hello!<br>
<br>
I decided to create a simple website listing everything I've<br>
archived through the years. Since most of the stuff I archive<br>
are flash sites which work on the Wii, I thought I'd use the old<br>
concept I made for the Open Shop Channel.<br>
<br>
Everything listed here is saved on the Internet Archive, being either<br>
websites and online games saved to the WayBack Machine or shareware<br>
software saved to the Internet Archive's shareware library.<br>
<br>
I can't upload anything copyrighted, but there's still a lot of stuff<br>
I can archive that hasn't been archived yet.<br>
<br>
I only list stuff I've archived myself and are new to the Internet<br>
Archive or were missing assets (mostly flash content).<br>
<br>
I will try my best to provide updates on the front page about<br>
new additions.<br>
